The Cricket Player Performance Dashboard is an interactive application that helps users understand how cricket players perform over different years by looking at their batting and bowling statistics. The dashboard uses real player data and shows it in the form of simple charts and numbers so that anyone can easily understand the performance of players. The main purpose of this dashboard is to study how players score runs, how consistently they play, and how well they take wickets. It helps users see which players perform better, how their performance changes over time, and what patterns can be observed from the data. The dashboard makes complex cricket statistics easy to understand by converting them into visual graphs and summaries.

The dashboard also provides interactive filters that allow users to choose specific players and select a range of years for analysis. This means the user can customize the dashboard based on their interest and focus only on certain players or time periods. It also shows important summary values such as total runs scored, total wickets taken, and average strike rate. These values help users quickly understand the overall performance of the selected players without needing to study all the data in detail. This makes the dashboard simple to use and helpful for comparing player performance.

The dashboard is divided into two main sections: batting analysis and bowling analysis. In the batting section, different charts show how many runs players scored over time, compare total runs among players, and explain the relationship between batting average and strike rate. These graphs help users understand which players are consistent, which players score quickly, and how strong their batting performance is. By looking at these charts, users can easily identify top batting performers and see how their performance changes across years.

The bowling section focuses on how players perform as bowlers by showing the number of wickets taken and how bowling performance changes over different years. The charts in this section help users identify strong bowlers and observe performance patterns. The visualizations make it easy to see which players take more wickets and which players show consistent bowling performance. Overall, the dashboard provides useful insights about cricket player performance by presenting the data in a clear and simple way, helping users understand trends, compare players, and make data-driven observations about cricket performance.
